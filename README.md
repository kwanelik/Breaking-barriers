# Breaking barriers

Posted here, for transparency, is the analysis plan for the project: "Breaking barriers in STEM: The effect of 
protected characteristics and their intersectionality on career transition in academics". The data come from a 
survey sent out to early career researchers in the evolutionary biology community in 2017. This analysis plan was 
created prior to any data analysis. 

# What is the purpose of this project?

In recent years the academic community has made great progress in addressing the historic under-representation of 
women in STEM. What has received less attention are the minorities identifying with other protected
characteristics. Protected groups are identified in the Equality Act 2010 as sharing a particular characteristic 
against which it is illegal to discriminate, such as race/ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation
There has been very little discussion with regards the effect of coming from a protected group, despite 
evidence that this can have a strong effect on the probability of retaining an academic career. We wish to 
explore some of the challenges faced by scientists who do not come from a ‘traditional’ background, and how some 
of these challenges can be overcome.
